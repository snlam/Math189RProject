Performed analysis on corpus of 3 million poetry lines using K-means clustering algorithm. 
Poetry lines were vectorized by averaging component word vectors. 
Cosine similarity for metric.

Goal: can we cluster poetry lines by time period using inherent stylistic or semantic qualities in each line?

Further work: create more accurate sentence vectorization technique,  check validity of clustering algorithm used (or even try different clustering algorithms [hierarchical, mixed guass, etc.]), apply analysis to different datasets of poetry lines or words.
